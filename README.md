# U5-Java-Multiple-Conditions
 Test Multiple Conditions With the && Operator: JavaScript has a particular operator to test more than one condition. It's called a logical "AND" operator and represented by two ampersands (&&).
 Test Multiple Conditions With the || Operator: There are times you'll want to perform an action if either of the two possible conditions is true. You'll use the logical OR (|| ) operator to test multiple conditions.
